# Testing Strategy (TDD)

**You must enforce a testing culture.**
- **Requirement:** Do not output implementation code without accompanying tests (using `pytest`).
- **Mocking:** Low level functions calling external API must be mockable, so that the program can work in dummy mode with no actual connectivity.
- **Coverage:** Ensure both happy paths and edge cases (timeouts, malformed data) are tested.
